# Physical Chemistry Laboratory II #

### Chemistry 357, Spring 2020 ###

Instructor
:
Dustin Wheeler, Ph.D.  
Office: HN1313B  
Office hours: By appointment only  
Email: <dustin.wheeler@hunter.cuny.edu>

Course goal
: 
Chemistry 357 is a physical chemistry laboratory course. By the end of this course, you will have experience with the a number of techniques related to kinetics and quantum chemical phenomena. You will learn a variety of instrumental and computational techniques designed to help you understand fundamental chemical processes.  

: This course is intended to help you grow as a scientist by: 
: 
1. exposing you to a variety of modeling and characterization techniques, and
2. guiding you towards the development of better reasoning and critical thinking skills for problem solving.

Books
: 
**Required:** One carbon copy laboratory notebook (available in the Hunter College bookstore). 
You do not need to buy a textbook for this class. I will provide handouts or post the relevant material on Blackboard for you. You should print out each lab and _must_ complete a summary of the lab procedure in your notebook before you come to class. 

: 
If you are interested in purchasing a physical laboratory book (entirely optional), many of our experiments will be modified from the standard physical chemistry laboratory lab manual by Garland, Nibler, and Shoemaker: _Experiments in Physical Chemistry,_ 7th Ed., 2003, McGraw-Hill, New York, NY.
 
Grading
: 
Your grade for this course will be based on the following factors:
: 
- Attendance and participation in each and every laboratory period (40%)
- A series of laboratory assignments (lab reports) to be completed at home. (60%)
	- Pre-lab preparation (10% of each lab report)

: 
Lab writeups for are due at the start of the class period following the completion lab. Writeups should be clear, concise evaluations of the experiment, including any observations, experimental procedures, instrumental methods and instrumentation used, computational methods and results, and any additional analyses you performed.  

Web site
: 
As part of the course we will be using [Blackboard](https://bbhosted.cuny.edu).  Instructions on how to access the course website on Blackboard can be found at: <http://bb.hunter.cuny.edu>. In addition to instructions for individual labs, announcements and additional resources will occasionally be posted on Blackboard. 

Attendance and Tardiness
: 
Your attendance in each and every lab is mandatory. There will be no makeup labs offered for this course. For safety reasons, if you are **more than 15 minutes late** for class, you will not be permitted to perform the lab and you will lose participation points for the session. 

Lab Safety
:
- First and foremost you will be _**required**_ to wear safety goggles at _**all**_ times when in the laboratory. If you are caught without safety glasses on more than one occasion you will be asked to leave the lab.
- Open-toed shoes are not permitted in the laboratory.
- No food or drink is allowed in the laboratory at any time.
- Do not sniff or taste _**any**_ of the chemicals you will be using.
- Toxic substances must be used only under the hood. You will be responsible for looking up and understanding the MSDS of **all** chemicals used in the laboratory.
- All cell phones, pagers, CD players, MP3 players, etc. must be turned off (or at least on silent) while in the laboratory.

Academic Integrity Statement
: 
Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (_e.g.,_ plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. 

:

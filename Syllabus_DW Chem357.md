# Physical Chemistry Laboratory II #

### Chemistry 357, Spring 2022 ###

Instructor
:
Dustin Wheeler, Ph.D.  
Office: HN1313B  
Office hours: Remotely, by appointment only  
Email: <dustin.wheeler@hunter.cuny.edu>

Course goal
: 
Chemistry 357 is a laboratory course in physical chemistry. By the end of this course, you will have experience with a  variety of instrumental and computational techniques designed to help you understand fundamental processes  related to kinetics and quantum chemical phenomena.  

: This course is intended to help you grow as a scientist by: 
: 
1. exposing you to a variety of chemical modeling and characterization techniques, and
2. developing your reasoning and critical thinking skills for better problem solving.

Course Materials
: 
**Required:** One carbon copy laboratory notebook (available in the Hunter College bookstore). 
There is no textbook for this course. I will provide handouts or post the relevant material on Blackboard for you. You should print out each lab and _must_ complete a summary of the lab procedure in your notebook before you come to class. 

:
A USB drive for retrieving data from the various instruments used in the course. 

: 
If you are interested in purchasing a physical laboratory book (entirely optional), many of our experiments will be modified from the standard physical chemistry laboratory lab manual by Garland, Nibler, and Shoemaker: _Experiments in Physical Chemistry,_ 7th Ed., 2003, McGraw-Hill, New York, NY.

Web site
: 
Course communication, lectures, help sessions, and announcements will be posted on the course page in [Microsoft Teams][ms-teams]. All students should have been invited to the team prior to the start of the semester. To log in, use your CUNYlogin address (fname.lname##@login.cuny.edu). Please contact the course instructor and the [Student HelpDesk](mailto:studenthelpdesk@hunter.cuny.edu) if you have issues connecting to the course. 
<!--Instructions on how to access the course website on Blackboard can be found on the [Hunter College BlackBoard Announcement page][bb-announce]. In addition to instructions for individual labs, announcements and additional resources will occasionally be posted on Blackboard. -->

Attendance and Tardiness
: 
Your attendance in each and every lab is mandatory. There will be no makeup labs offered for this course. For safety reasons, if you are **more than 15 minutes late** for class, you will not be permitted to perform the lab and you will lose participation points for the session. 

Lab Safety
:
- First and foremost you will be **required** to wear safety goggles at **all** times when in the laboratory. If you are caught without safety glasses on more than one occasion you will be asked to leave the lab.
- Open-toed shoes are not permitted in the laboratory.
- No food or drink is allowed in the laboratory at any time.
- Do not sniff or taste **any** of the chemicals you will be using.
- Toxic substances must be used only under the hood. You will be responsible for looking up and understanding the MSDS of **all** chemicals used in the laboratory.
- All cell phones, pagers, CD players, MP3 players, etc. must be turned off (or at least on silent) while in the laboratory.

Grading
: 
Your grade for this course will be based on the following factors:
: 
- Attendance and participation in every laboratory period (**40%** of semester grade)
- A series of laboratory summaries (5) to be completed at home (**20%** of semester grade)
	- Pre-lab preparation (10% of each lab report)
	- Summaries should include Procedure, Results/Discussion, and Appendix sections (60 points total)
- A series of laboratory reports (3) to be completed at home (**30%** of semester grade)
	- Pre-lab preparation (10% of each lab report)
	- Lab reports should be written in the style of *The Journal of Physical Chemistry A* (JPCA). If you are unfamiliar with this style, please look up a few articles in a recent issue to familiarize yourself with the format. The [Information for Authors][jpca-auth-info] page and [Author Guidelines][jpca-auth-guide] (specifically the author guidelines section on *Manuscript Text Components*) may be helpful if you aren't sure how to structure a manuscript. Templates (MS Word and LaTeX) are available for download on the course Blackboard page. 
- A final group presentation based on one of the labs performed during the semester. More details will be given later in the semester. (**10%** of semester grade)
: 
Pre-lab preparation is worth 10% of the grade for each summary or report. Summaries are due one week after the completion of the lab, while full reports are due two weeks after completing the lab. Write-ups should be clear, concise evaluations of the experiment, including any observations, experimental procedures, instrumental methods and instrumentation used, computational methods and results, and any additional analyses you performed. Please see the JPCA author guidelines for details on these sections. 
:
The table below shows which sections should be included in each assignment and how many points each section is worth.

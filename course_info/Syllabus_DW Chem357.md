Course goal
: Chemistry 357 is a laboratory course in physical chemistry. By the end of this course, you will have experience with a  variety of instrumental and computational techniques designed to help you understand fundamental processes related to kinetics and quantum chemical phenomena.  

: This course is intended to help you grow as a scientist by: 
    1. exposing you to a variety of chemical modeling and characterization techniques, and
    2. developing your reasoning and critical thinking skills for better problem solving.

Course Materials
: **Required:** One carbon copy laboratory notebook (available in the Hunter College bookstore). A bound (_not_ spiral) notebook is also acceptable, though it should have pre-numbered pages. A USB flash storage drive will be necessary to retrieve data from various instrumentation. 

: There is no textbook for this course. I will provide handouts or post the relevant material on Blackboard for you. You should print out each lab and _must_ complete a summary of the lab procedure in your notebook before you come to class. 

: If you are interested in purchasing a physical laboratory book (entirely optional), many of our experiments will be modified from the standard physical chemistry laboratory lab manual by Garland, Nibler, and Shoemaker: _Experiments in Physical Chemistry,_ 7th Ed., 2003, McGraw-Hill, New York, NY.

Web site
: Course communication, lectures, help sessions, and announcements will be posted on the course page in [Microsoft Teams][ms-teams]. All students should have been invited to the team prior to the start of the semester. 

: Computational work for the course will be performed with [JupyterLab][JupyterLab] on shared departmental resources. This server can be accessed at <https://sugarcube.hunter.cuny.edu>. Students will need to create an account using the "Sign up" link below the login window. 
<!--Instructions on how to access the course website on Blackboard can be found on the [Hunter College BlackBoard Announcement page][bb-announce]. In addition to instructions for individual labs, announcements and additional resources will occasionally be posted on Blackboard. -->

Attendance and Tardiness
: 
Your attendance in each and every lab is mandatory. There will be no makeup labs offered for this course. For safety reasons, if you are **more than 15 minutes late** for class, you will not be permitted to perform the lab and you will lose participation points for the session. 

Lab Safety
: 
- First and foremost you will be **required** to wear safety goggles at **all** times when in the laboratory. If you are caught without safety glasses on more than one occasion you will be asked to leave the lab.
- Open-toed shoes are not permitted in the laboratory. 
- No food or drink is allowed in the laboratory at any time. 
- Do not sniff or taste **any** of the chemicals you will be using. 
- Toxic substances must be used only under the hood. You will be responsible for looking up and understanding the MSDS of **all** chemicals used in the laboratory. 
- Cell phones should be silenced prior to coming in to lab. Please refrain from using phones during the lab session. Your attention should be focused on the work being performed, and distractions can be dangerous when working with some of the equipment.


Grading
: Your grade for this course will be based on the following factors:
: 
- Attendance and participation in every laboratory period. You will work in groups of two on all experiments; your partner will remain the same all semester. (**30%** of semester grade) 
- Practice exercises for lab-related skills, graded for completion (**15%** of semester grade)
- Summaries for four lab exercises, details given below. (**15%** of semester grade) 
- Written lab reports for two labs, details given below. (**30%** of semester grade) 
- A final group presentation based on one of the labs performed during the semester. More details will be given later in the semester. (**10%** of semester grade)

: Pre-lab preparation is worth 10 points of the grade for each summary or report. At the end of each lab period, you will be required to clean up your work and submit your notebook to the instructor for sign-off. Failure to do either of these will result in a loss of participation points for the lab and 10 points from the submitted report or summary. 

: Summaries are due *one week* after the completion of the lab, while full reports are due *two weeks* after completing the lab. 

: The table below shows which sections should be included in each assignment and how many points each section is worth.

:
{{Lab report rubric.md}}
- Prior to arriving for each experimental lab, a pre-lab should be completed. This should contain an outline or flowchart of steps to be taken in the lab. It should be written in such a way that you can follow each step quickly and accurately during the lab, without needing to refer back to some section of the lab guide. Another researcher looking at your notebook should be able to replicate your work with relatively little difficulty, and your pre-lab is the start to this "instruction set". All masses, volumes, etc. should be calculated ahead of time, and a list of necessary equipment should be included so you can come in to lab, collect your equipment, and begin working within a few minutes. 
- Summaries should include Procedure and Appendix sections. The Appendix should include your data analysis and any resultant figures or tables, as well as a comparison to literature values (with references). Each summary will be focused on one particular component of the analysis work (_e.g.,_ figure preparation, data manipulation, error analysis). Focus topics for each summary analysis are listed in the experiment descriptions below. Your summary should also include a rough outline of your discussion points, _e.g.,_ answers to any questions posed in the lab manual, observations about trends shown in your data, commentary on any sources of error, etc.
- Lab reports should be clear, concise evaluations of the experiment, including any observations, experimental procedures, instrumental methods and instrumentation used, computational methods and results, and any additional analyses you performed. Lab reports should be written in the style of [_The Journal of Physical Chemistry A_ (JPCA)][jpca-home]. If you are unfamiliar with this style, please look up a few articles in a recent issue to familiarize yourself with the format. The [Information for Authors][jpca-auth-info] page and [Author Guidelines][jpca-auth-guide] (specifically the author guidelines section on _Manuscript Text Components_) may be helpful if you aren't sure how to structure a manuscript. Please structure the report section of your Jupyter notebooks accordingly (*i.e.,* header cells for each section, formatted text/equations, inline figures created from your analysis section, and formatted references listed at the end).

<!-- TODO: Need to decide how summaries are gradedâ€¦ Need a way to include some written response 
    in the grade, but not a full discussion. Are all the questions in the lab guide appropriate 
    for a summary? Need to edit question list. -->

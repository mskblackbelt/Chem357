@inbook{shirley95,
	Abstract = {Proteins are synthesized as a linear chain of amino acids. In order to become biologically active, a protein must fold and adopt one out of an enormous number of possible conformations. This conformation, which we will refer to as the native state, exists in solution as a very compact, highly ordered structure. This native state structure results from a delicate balance between large and opposing forces. In order to form the native state, the forces that favor the unfolded state (mainly conformational entropy) must be overcome by the covalent and noncovalent interactions favoring the folded protein (seeChapter 1). Under physiological conditions the native (folded) and the denatured (unfolded) states of a protein are in equilibrium. The free energy change, △G, for the equilibrium reaction 1is referred to as the conformational stability of a protein. The determinants of native state stability in aqueous solutions are the amino acid sequence of the protein as well as the variable conditions of pH, temperature, and the concentration of salts and ligands (1, 2). Although the native conformation is essential for activity, the conformational stability is remarkably low. The native state of most naturally occurring proteins is only about 5--15 kcal/mol more stable than its unfolded conformations (3).},

@article{flory48,
	Abstract = {Abstract Polyvinyl alcohol prepared by hydrolyzing polymerized vinyl acetate is partially degraded within a few minutes by reagents known to attack 1,2-glycol structures. The degree of degradation is limited, however, the final molecular weights of the degraded products being in the range of 3700 to 6500 (viscosity averages). The extent of degradation seems to depend solely on the temperature at which the vinyl acetate was polymerized. Mole percentages (based on the structural unit CH2CHOH) of 1,2-glycol structures, corresponding to head-to-head unit arrangements, have been computed from the degree of degradation with periodic acid. They increase from about 1.23\% for polymerization at 25$\,^{\circ}$C. to 1.95\% at 110$\,^{\circ}$C. The occurrence of head-to-head structures is attributed to occasional ``abnormal'' addition of monomer in the chain-growth phase of the polymerization. The activation energy for the abnormal addition reaction is 1250 calories higher than for the normal (preferred) addition; the steric factor for the abnormal addition is about one-tenth that for the normal addition.},

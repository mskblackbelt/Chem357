# Python Introduction for Physical Chemistry

Students should end up with a feel for programming in Python and interacting with the JupyterHub/JupyterLab interface. Use MolSSI course for [Python Scripting for Computational Molecular Science](https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/) as a template. Basic skills students should have by the end of the exercise:

- Create a notebook
- Do basic arithmetic operations
- Assign a value to a variable
- Define a simple function
- Import a 
  - library
  - function from a library
- Work with the file system (use [`pathlib`](https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/))
  - Navigate and list files
  - Read a text file
  - Write a file
- Work with tabular data
  - Read in tabular data using `numpy` functions
  - Work with data in `numpy` arrays
- Plot data using `matplotlib`
  - Create a dataset using a function
  - Create a plot from a dataset
  - Label plot axes, title, legend, etc.
  - Plot multiple graphs in one figure 
  - Save figure to a file

Should this content be separated from the plotting lesson? Or should plotting follow naturally on from this?
